DomuPi

DomuPi is a **modular Raspberry Pi project** that turns a single board into a multi-purpose digital hub.  
The core idea is simple: one Pi that can act as a **private router**, a **home automation controller**, a **NAS**, or even the brain of a **smart desk** â€” depending on what modules you enable.  

At its foundation, DomuPi functions as:  
- **Private Router**: connects to public/captive Wi-Fi (like residence/public networks) and rebroadcasts it through a Wi-Fi dongle as a secure personal hotspot.  
- **Home Assistant**: integrates IoT devices and runs local automations.  
- **NAS**: shares local or external storage across your network.  
- **Smart Desk Core**: coordinates screens,AI, and widgets as a personized mini desk asistant.
